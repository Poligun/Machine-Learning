# Machine-Learning
A simple machine learning toolkits I've written for my NLP homework assignments.

Implemented tools include:
  
### Optimization
  - Implemented **Gradient Check**
  - Implemented **Stochastic Gradient Descent**, currently only supports *BFGS* and *l-BFGS* algorithms

### Indexer
  - For large training dataset please use **Incremental Indexer**

### Classification and Regression
  - Implemented **Logistic Regression**. To run softmax (multinomial logistic regression), please enable L2 regularization.
  - TODO:
    - Allow user to set number of threads
    - Add L1 regularization.
